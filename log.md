# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 21, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 day challenge and have decided to work on the PRM Application

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. I feel like I need to be deliberate in my focus so I can achieve my goals in game development.

**Link to work:** Nothing yet...
